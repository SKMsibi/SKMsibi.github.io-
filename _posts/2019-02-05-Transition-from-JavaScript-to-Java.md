## Why the change.
Growing up, one of my uncles was a builder and whenever he got an opportunity to give me advice he would always use his career and good building skills as an example.
He would always say, "As a builder, I try to know how to use all available tools because that gives me knowledge on how to build the same or different thing but faster and more efficient".
This would make me want to know everything about anything I was introduces to, and now that I am a developer and I too am a builder of software, I can't help but think if learning another
language is like my uncle learning how to use another tool, and so I had came to the decision that learning many useful and efficient languages would help me become a better software developer.
It would help me become a more versatile developer.

## Why Java.
Well Java is a great language, It is the most popular language in the world today for a reason.
It is reasonably simple, modern, fast and it is evolving.
There are a lot jobs that are looking for people who know Java.
