# Drop it task.
What is the drop it task.?
The drop it task is a one of the tasks from free code camp that help individuals to  learn full stack JavaScript and agile software development.

## What the drop it tasks requires.
The drop it task requires that an individual should create an algorithm that is able to Drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) returns true.
The second argument, func, is a function that will be used to test the first elements of the array to decide if you should drop it or not.

## How I solved the task.
I created a function called dropElement taking in two parameters, one being the given array and the other being the given function.
Inside the four loop I introduced a for loop that iterated through the given array and and passed in each element in the array as an argument in the given function then have the function executed.
Once the given for loop comes across an element that passed the given function and slices from the position of the element that passed to the end of the array.

## conclusion.
In conclusion the function works as a drop method that will drop the an element that failed and the ones before it and leaving the remaining.
