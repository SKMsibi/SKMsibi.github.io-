## Using Break and Continue.
These two sound very different and are actually different.
Many people don't use them because in many cases you don't have but in others, they might be of great use.
another reason for people not to use them is because they don't know how they work.
They just assume that as their names describe them then its actually how they work.

Well, how about an outline of the difference between the two.
### BREAK
used in loops the BREAK statement is used to exit the loop.
It skips the rest of the code following it, but only the code within the loop and exits the loop.
### CONTINUE
also used in loops the  Continue statement is used to skip to the next iteration of the loop.
It skips all the code following after it, but only the code within the loop and it skips to the next iteration.
