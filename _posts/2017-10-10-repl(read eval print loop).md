### REPL.
Read Eval Print Loop (REPL).

A Read Eval Print Loop is an interactive interpreter to a programming language.
It originated with LISP systems, but many other languages.
They allow for simple experimentation with a language.

The four components to a REPL.
Read : reads input from the keyboard.
Eval : evaluates code passed to it.
Print : formats and displays results.
Loop : runs the three previous commands until termination.

The main idea of the REPL is to start an interactive console where you can type in commands and immediately see the results of these commands.
