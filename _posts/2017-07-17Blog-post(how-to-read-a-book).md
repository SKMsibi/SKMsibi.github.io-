###How to read a book.

This book made me realise the importance of knowing the level of reading that could be most advantegeus to any individual that wants to gain knowledge or just know some information.

Syntopical level opened my mind and view on what to focus on when reading books on the same topic.
Motivated me to read more books on the same topic, compare and contrast as that will be very advantegues to my intalect growth, knowledge growth, and get an insight on different views onto that specific topic from different people.
