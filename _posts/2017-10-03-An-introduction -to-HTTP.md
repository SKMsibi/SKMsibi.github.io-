### What is HTTP.
When individual start wondering about how the internet works, the first thing many individuals are more curious about is how information is transported from one device to another and how it is able to be displayed on the browser.

This is where HTTP comes in the picture.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative and hypermedia information system.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text.

### HTTP request methods.
GET : Requests data from a specified resource.
POST : Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
HEAD : Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.
PUT : Uploads a representation of the specified URL.
DELETE : Deletes the specified resource.
OPTIONS : Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports.
CONNECT : Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.
