### My observations from last week.
The previous week was a very interesting week field with learning and exploring new factors and theories i did not know of before.
I realized that my biggest challenge is challenging myself enough, keeping tract of my progress in typing and finding  new ways to challenge myself with factors i am familiar with.
I have a difficult time explaining something using the correct terms

### How can i improve.
Familiarize myself with programming terms that will make me better at explaining and increase and make my understanding better.
Practice more on typing to get better at typing.
Read and research more on the topics im given.
Challenge myself and feed my curiosity to gain more knowledge.
