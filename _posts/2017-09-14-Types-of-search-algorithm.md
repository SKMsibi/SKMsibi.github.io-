### what is to search.
To scan through or checks through a list of data and retrieving the desired data within the data.

### types of search algorithm.

## linear search.
The linear search checks the values in sequence until the desired value is found.
It involves checking each element of the list in turn, until the desired element is found.

## Binary search.
The binary search requires a sorted input list.
It checks for the value in the middle of the list.
Repeatedly not considering the half of the list which contains values which are definitely either all larger or all smaller than the desired value.
