### Base58.
Base58 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes used to represent large integers as alphanumeric text.
It is therefore designed for human users who manually enter the data, copying from some visual source.
Compared to Base64, the following similar-looking letters are omitted: 0 (zero), O (capital o), I (capital i) and l (lower case L) as well as the non-alphanumeric characters + (plus) and / (slash).
Base58Check is a Base58 encoding format that unambiguously encodes the type of data in the first few characters and includes an error detection code in the last few characters.

### Complex datatype.
Any data that does not fall into the traditional field structure (alpha, numeric, dates) of a relational DBMS.
A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. 
The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.

### Simple datatype.
Is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block.
