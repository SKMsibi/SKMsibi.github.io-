### Internet of things.
The internet of things (IoT) is a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices.
IoT is significant because an object that can represent itself digitally becomes something greater than the object by itself.
This means no longer does the object relate just to its user, but is now connected to surrounding objects and database data. 
Due to the connection of everyday physical objects to the internet this has changed the definition of IoT.
Definition: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

The Internet of Things promises to transform a wide range of fields. Like Urban Planning and Medicine.
