## Being introduced to React.
Early this year I was introduced to react, How it looked and how it worked had me asking myself "Why would someone go and create such a thing, HTML works just fine and so does Javascript. Why would someone want to create confusion trying to make something to help people carry out certain tasks easier when those people are doing just fine with how they carrying out those tasks?".
A few weeks down the line I was now asking myself a different question, "why did it take long for someone to create a great tool like this?"
## Learning React.
Learning React was and still is one of the best things I have ever enjoyed in life. I find myself overwhelmed with every discovery I make.
Things like being and to use a component multiple times, the presence of state, component life-cycle, properties etc where a complete game changer for me.
I found myself being attached to React and favoring it over other JavaScript library.
