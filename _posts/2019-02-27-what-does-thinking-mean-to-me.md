## What does thinking mean to me.
I consider thinking as an activity where an individual uses their brain to consider different aspects about something.
Not only just aspect but also includes reasoning, personal and rational judgement.

Thinking means trying to use enough data to get more data about something then using all that data to come to a conslusion.
