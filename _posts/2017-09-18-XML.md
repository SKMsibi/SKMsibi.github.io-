### XML.
eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
This markup language was designed to describe, store and transport data .
XML is much similar to (HTML) Hyper-Text Mark-up language. 
Both XML and HTML contain markup symbols to describe page or file contents. 

HTML code describes Web page content (mainly text and graphic images) only in terms of how it is to be displayed and interacted with.
XML data is known as self-describing or self-defining, meaning that the structure of the data is embedded with the data.
Thus when the data arrives there is no need to pre-build the structure to store the data.

XML is made up of elements, defined by tags.
An element has a beginning and an ending tag.
All elements in an XML document are contained in an outermost element known as the root element.
XML can also support nested elements, or elements within elements.
