### Goto 
Is a statement found in many computer programming languages. 
It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code; in contrast a function call normally returns control.
A goto statement in C programming provides an unconditional jump from the 'goto' to a labeled statement in the same function.

### CDN
A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server.
