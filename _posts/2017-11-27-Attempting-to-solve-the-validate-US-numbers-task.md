# The US number system.
The United States of America has a system where they use a collection of numbers as a telephone number.
The U.S has 10 digits in its telephone number systems and sometimes 11 including their code number.
The code number is used for international telecommunication. It is always the first digit in the sequence of the numbers and is always 1 for the U.S.

## Attempting to validate a given sequence of numbers.
referring to six different acceptable sequences the task would pass in a random sequence and the algorithm is supposed to validate if the given sequence matches any of the given six for reference.
The following are the different number sequences to be used as reference.
 - 555-555-5555
 - (555)555-5555
 - (555) 555-5555
 - 555 555 5555
 - 5555555555
 - 1 555 555 5555

A combination of valid number sequences is also accepted as valid e.g
1 (555) 555-5555    

## challenges faced.
checking if the given sequence matches any of the valid references was not much of a challenge but getting it to work for combinations of valid sequences was one of the biggest challenge.
Another challenge faced was having the algorithm to work and have not too many lines of code.
