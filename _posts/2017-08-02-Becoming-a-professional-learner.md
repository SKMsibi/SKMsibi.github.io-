Reading a blog post by Uncle Bob made me realise that i dont need or have to depend higher education to become a fullstack developer.
Unlce Bob once said " a Computer Science degree is not an adequate indicator of software professionalism despite our industry's tendency to use it as such." and the very same words inspire me today.
We can teach more competently when we can learn more holistically.
Classroom-based teaching does not suffice. Software professionals are created from experiences that force them to re-orient the manner and purpose with which they learn.
