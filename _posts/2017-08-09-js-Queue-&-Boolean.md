### Queue
 A queue is an abstact data structure where items are kept in order.
New items are added at the back of the queue and old items are added at the front of the queue.
Queues can be implemented in JavaScript using either the push and shift methods or unshift and pop methods of the array objec.

### Boolean
The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false".
Boolean expressions can compare data of any type as long as both parts of the expression have the same basic data type.
You can test data to see if it is equal to, greater than, or less than other data.
