### Syntax.

The set of rules that define the combination of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured document or fragment in that language.

The syntax of a language defines its surface form.

The syntax can be applied to both programming language and markup languages.

### Markup language.

It is a system for annotating a document in a way that is formally distinguishable from text.

Their specification prescribes how to present the structured data.

### Liquid Template Language.

This language allows the user to display data in a template.

It creates a bridge between an HTML  file and data store.

A templateing language basically is a language which allows defining placeholders that should later on be replaced for the purpose of implementing designs.

Modern template languages do not only support placeholders, but also loops and conditions which are often necessary for designing a web page.
