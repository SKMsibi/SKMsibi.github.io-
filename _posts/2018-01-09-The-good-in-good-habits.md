## Turning common practices into good habits.
    - Common practice :  something that is done a lot and is considered normal.
    - habit : The definition of habit is something that you do regularly, or an addiction.

As I started attending at **The Coding Ground** craftsmanship academy I have unconsciously came up with new common practices that I contribute greatly to my growth mentally and morally.
I consider these common practices as good and they contribute to the development of my growth, they help me learn and they are a part of what I learn.

Examples of a few common practices I had adopted.
    - problem-solving.
    - committing and pushing to Github.
    - typing and practicing typing.
    - searching and reading new information.

I had been engaging in all the listed practices and more on daily bases. I didn't notice their importance and their significant impact until I went away for festive holidays about a month and came back.
note through the entire period of the festive holidays I had not been engaging in the practices.

As soon as I came back to **The Coding Ground** I went back to engaging in the practices. I realized that I was having a difficult time doing what I always did before.
I had forgotten how to do some practices.
Having a difficult time getting used to what you were used to made me realize that sometimes we take repartition for granted. We might not see what we learn from them how much of an impact that it played.
It made me realize that if normal practices became a way of life, why not make good habits a way of life too, then and only then would one of our good habits do they turn into our strongest points.
