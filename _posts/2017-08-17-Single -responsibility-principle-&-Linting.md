### Single responsibility principle.
single responsibility principle is a computer programming principle that states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

### Linting.
A well structured code is easy to monitor and spot errors but in reality not all developers construct a well structured code and trying to spot potential errors might be time consuming, frustrating and energy consuming. This is where Linting comes into good use.
Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors before you compile, link, and run it.
This is most helpful in identifying some common and uncommon mistakes that are made during coding.

Linting is the process of checking the source code for Programmatic as well as Stylistic errors. This is most helpful in identifying some common and uncommon mistakes that are made during coding.

A Lint or a Linter is a tool (program) that supports linting (verifying code quality). They are available for most languages like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python, etc..

A Lint also helps in the following:
 -  formatting discrepancy 
 -  non-adherence to coding standards and conventions 
 -  pinpointing possible logical errors in your program
 -  ensures that the source code is legible and readable
 -  ensures that the source code is less polluted and easy to maintain
