# Solving the finders keepers challenge.
What is the finder's keeper's challenge?
The finders keepers challenge is a challenge on free code camp that requires an individual to:
Create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument).
The second argument is a function.

## Solving the challenge.
Having the to create a function take in two arguments one being an array and the other being a function meant that the function has to be passed in as a non-executable function then later being executed.
In creating the function titled findElements with two arguments, I also created a for loop that would iterate through the first argument being the array and passing each element in the array into the function that is being called in an if statement checking if the results of the function are true or not.
If true then the if statement would return the element of the array that passed the function passed in as an argument and if false then the next element in the array would be passed in the function and the function would be executed and have the results checked.

## conclusion.
Iso doing the findElements function proved to work as a search and find method in an array.
