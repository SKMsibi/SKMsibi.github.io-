### LOOP.

A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

### Types of Loops.
FOR LOOP =	A for loop is a loop that runs for a preset number of times.
WHILE LOOP =	A while loop is a loop that is repeated as long as an expression is true. An expression is a statement that has a value.
DO WHILE LOOP =	A do while loop or repeat until loop repeats until an expression becomes false.
INFINITE =	An infinite or endless loop is a loop that repeats indefinitely because it has no terminating condition, the exit condition is never met or the loop is instructed to start over from the beginning.
NESTED =	A nested loop appears inside any other for, while or do while loop.

### Loop control statement.
A statement that alters the execution of a loop from its designated sequence is a loop control statement.

examples of a loop control statements.

    A break statement inside a loop terminates the loop immediately.
    A continue statement jumps to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any code in between.
