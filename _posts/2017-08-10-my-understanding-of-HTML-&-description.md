### Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

An HTML page is made up of HTML elements that build the structure of the HTML page.
Using HTML elements images, videos, audio, links and interactive forms can be embedded into the HTML page.
Text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items can be formated to have a custom or proffesional look.

HTML elements are outlined by tags, written using angle brackets. E.g <p>...</p> mark the beggining<p> of a paragraph and the end</p> of a paragraph, it also surrounds and provides information about document text and may include other tags.
