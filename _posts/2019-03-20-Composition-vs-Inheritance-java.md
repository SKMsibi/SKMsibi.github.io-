# Composition vs Inheritance.

### Composition
*def :* a process that allows a class to references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.

When a fieldâ€™s type is a class, the field will hold a reference to another object, creating an association relationship between them.
A class can have multiple 
 <!-- association, aggregation, and composition -->

### Inheritance
*def :* a process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.

A class can inherit the fields and methods of its superclass(parent).
A class can inherit from another class which inherits from another class, and so on, up to a base class.
Subclasses(child) may override some methods and/or fields to alter the default behavior.
