### (What i learnt at The Coding Ground.)

The difference between Dynamic and static typing goes beyond just type systems.:


 **Static language.**
	
	-The compliler checks the Types for errors or mistakes before running the program.
	
	-The variable needs to be declared what type of variable it is beforehand.

 **Dynami language.**
	
	-On the other hand with Dynamic typse are only checked as the program is running.
	
	-There is no need to declare what type of variable it is, the language will figure it out during runtime.

### The Five generations of programming languages.:

 First generation.

	-First Generation Languages use a binary code that consists of strings of only zeroes.0 and ones.1.

 Second generation.

	-uses mnemonics code that consists of very short words for commands. Assembly language programs need to be converted into machine language by an assembler before it can be run.

 Third generation.

	- Third generation languages are program writ- ten from one computer can also be use by another computer however the source code must be recompiled by a language compiler by the other computer.

 Fourth generation.

	-Fourth generation languages use English â€“ like commands. they focus more on what needs to be done rahter how to get it done.

 Fitth genearation.

	-Fifth Generation Languages are an artificial intelligence research from the 1980s. The approach is to build a program that implements a specific algorithm to solve problems. this generation is currently under development and growth.
