### Ternary operator.
The conditional (ternary) Operator is the only JavaScript operator that take's three operands.
This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the "if" statement.

### Template literals.
These are string literals allowing embedded expressions.
Multi-line strings and string interpolation features can be used with template literals.
Template literals are enclosed by the back-tick (` `) instead of single or double quotes.
Template literals can contain place-holders, that are indicated by the Dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).
