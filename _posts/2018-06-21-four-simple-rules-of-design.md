# Four simple rules of design.
When I was introduced to the four simple rules of design, I didn't understand why they were called rules and why are they do people value them so much.
I then started following them after reading a book about them, I soon realized why they were called rules.
They are called rules because if they are followed on a frequent level if not always they turn to have a huge impact on how one writes code, does tests, approaches the problem and the results of the project.
The Order of the rules is also significant thus. When the rules are applied on a constant rate they turn into unconscious behavior that benefits you in the daily lifestyle of writing code.

## The four simple rules of design.
* Tests pass
* Expresses intend
* No duplication (DRY)
* Small

### Tests pass.
This means writing tests and actually making sure that your design is doing its purpose and is working in the way it is supposed to cause if not then how do you even know the true nature of the design.

### Expresses intend.
The code should be self-explanatory.
This means every piece of code should be highlighting on what it's doing.
Things like functions, variables etc should just tell the reader what they're doing and why they contain.

### No duplication (DRY)
**Dont** **Repeat** **Yourself**.
This means there shouldn't be any duplication of code.
The concept of duplication here is very different, there might be two or more pieces of code that are similar but the context and way of doing things are very different thus merging them into one won't do the trick.
So duplication is declared as duplication when the similar or same code has the same context and concepts.

### small
Small means the code should not have peace of code that is not used, code that seems to be doing something but don't actually contribute to the design.

Reading about these rules made sense but I didn't see their impact, when I started following them and practicing them I slowly saw their impact but still didn't see their impact as to be great but when I had to explain them to someone else and write this blog post about them, I looked back at things that I had gained by following these rules and how much impact they had made on my approach on design and the end results. This made me value them even more than I ever did before.
