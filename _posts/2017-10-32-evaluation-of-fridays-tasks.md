On friday, I was given a couple of tasks to complete, I had to create functions that performed specific tasks on specific scenarios.
This was great, a chance to once again test my skills, knowledge and problem solving techniques.

When testing my code, when it was performing the tasks it was supposed to perform I noticed something, that I was quick to assume how the problem should be solve and in what cases it should work.
I wanted the code to work on so many possible scenarios that I had wondered off from the basic requirements to the ones I personally thought would be great for the code.

Yes the code could perform some amazing tricks, the problem was that it was not performing a few tricks it was supposed to perform.
From this I learnt one of the greatest lesson I could ever come across, always start off by solving the required challenge then move on to solving complex  challenges and adding extra stuff.

When I looked back to how I solved other previous tasks I noticed that assuming what the problem was, turned out to be a habit I have been entertaining for a very long time.
I then took a decision upon myself that from now on I will :

- To stop assuming.

- Break-down the task into smaller tasks.

- Frequently check i am still working on the given task.

- To give myself more tasks and practice not assuming.
