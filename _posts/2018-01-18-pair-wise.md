## The Pair wise algorithm.
### Instructions.
Given an array arr, find element pairs whose sum equal the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices.

If multiple pairs are possible that have the same numeric elements but different indices, return the smallest sum of indices. Once an element has been used, it cannot be reused to pair with another.

### How I wrote the Algorithm.
I created a function called **pairwise()** that had two parameters **arr** and **arg**.
Inside the function I created a variable called counter that was meant to store the number of indexes.
I then created a for loop iterating using arr's length and inside the for loop I created another for loop the as iterated through arr's length.
The difference between the two for loops is that they start at different indexes.
I then created an if statement statement that checked if both indexes in arr added together where equal to arg.
If so then both indexes would be added to the variable counter.
I then would return counter, this would result in the final answer being the number of indexes added together.

### the code.
`
function pairwise(arr, arg) {
    var counter = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (var a = i + 1; a < arr.length; a++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[a] === arg) {
                counter += i;
                counter += a;
                arr[i] = arr[a] = NaN;
            }
        }
    }
    return counter;
}
