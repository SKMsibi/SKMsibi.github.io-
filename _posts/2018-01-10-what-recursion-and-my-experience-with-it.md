## what is recursion.
 - Recursion : Recursion is a computer programming technique involving the use of a procedure, subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself.

## My experience with recursion.
Currently I fined that recursion is one technique that is powerful beyond its name if used in a correct way and in well suited conditions.
At first I understood the concept behind the technique recursion as the name and definition stated, but I because I did not know in which conditions to use the recursion technique I assumed I could use it everywhere and any time.
Like Abraham Maslow once said  **"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"**, in my case the recursion technique became a hammer to me and every problem I came across was a nail.

Due to using recursion in every solution I could think of and attempted, this caused allot of confusion because in other cases recursion would not work as I thought it did and in other cases it would break my code if not work at all.
After many fail attempts of trying to make recursion work in a problem that didn't need recursion, I tried a for loop and it worked.
I then realized that I may have one of the most powerful techniques and methods but when a problem doesn't need those methods, including them would just make a simple problem a big one.

This taught me an important lesson I think of first in every problem I attempt to solve on a daily bases.
It taught me that when solving a problem first think of the most easiest way to solve the problem and then slowly move to harder ways of solving it.
