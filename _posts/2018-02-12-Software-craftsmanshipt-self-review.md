## Personal book review.
Well I happen to have found the book very interesting.
When I had started reading the book, I had just started learning to code and anything to do with it.
I was very interested and keen to know about this software craftsmanship concept and how I can benefit from it.

In the first few chapters of the book, the author talks about different aspects and concepts like, the history of software development and Agile.
By the time I got to the chapter that spoke about Software craftsmanship I had lost interests in reading the book, I realized that the author might have aimed at enlightening the reader first about the history and other concepts that are similar to software craftsmanship so that when the user is reading about software craftsmanship they are able to differentiate it from the rest.
Yet in so doing I felt like I was reading a book that was telling me of something else either than what it said on its cover.

### My perspective on Software craftsmanship.
The author had outlined different definitions of software craftsmanship, the shortest being;
*“Software Craftsmanship is about professionalism in software development.”*
Although I personally think this definition is too broad.
I view software craftsmanship as a concept that focuses on:
 - *self development*
 - *continual learning*
 - *taking charge of ones career path*
 - *being responsible for self skill growth*
 - *adapting and keeping track of modern technologies*

### Sides of the book I found beneficial.
The book was specific and outlined the importance of Software craftsmanship, It promoted self development and even gave examples of aspects that can benefit an individual and help them develop.
It outlined key procedures in software development and in delivering.
The book justified how focusing on working software only is just not enough, it described how the quality of the product, flexibility and compatibility are important.
XP(Extreme Programming) technical practices are stated and discussed in detail.
One of the core chapters I found beneficial was the *Recruitment* chapter.
This chapter focused on how hiring the right developers is crucial for any software company and that the best developers can be hard to find.
