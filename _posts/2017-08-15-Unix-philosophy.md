### Unix philosophy.

I find the Unix philosophy very interesting and personally one of the best philosophies i have ever come across, maybe that might be so because i am yet to come across and stumble into better philosophies but till then the Unix philosophy reigns supreme.
This is so because the Unix philosophy outlines the basic but most important guide-lines of Software development.
Reading more about this philosophy changes my entire approach and perspective towards Software development.
Personally it is more of a tradition than a philosophy.

The following are the pillars of the Unix philosophy;
    (i) Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

    (ii) Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.

    (iii) Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

    (iv) Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.

The very same pillars summarized;
    (i) Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

    (ii) Write programs to work together.

    (iii) Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
