### Design thinking.
Is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems.
A design mind-set is solution-focused and action oriented towards creating a preferred outcome.
This methodology is given rise by Logic, Imagination, Intuition and Systemic reasoning.

### User Experience.

This is an individuals emotions and attitude about using a particular product, service or system.

### Paradigm.
This is a classification of programing languages. It classifies Programming language based on how it works, what it focuses on, how it performs certain tasks etc.
This classification made me realise that a programming language may be able to perform multiple, various tasks but its purpose is to handle certain types of tasks.
