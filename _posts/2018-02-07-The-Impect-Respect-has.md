## What is Respect.
A widely used term and most people don't know how to explain exactly what respect is and what role it plays in human behavior.
*Respect*: A feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements.
That is why this quote "Respect is earned and not demanded" is famous and widely used and well understood.
Simply because respect is a feeling of deep admiration, someone can never force some to feel a sense of respect for someone as the feeling of respect rising on its own due to different reasons that vary.

Most individuals confuse respect with fear and some even confuse respect for weakness.

In most cases, When a certain individual is of higher authority or of bigger physic individuals with less authority and physic might fear the individual due to the power they might have over that individual or due to physical overpowering.
This might be seen as respect as the individual with less authority will treat the one with higher authority with kindness and politeness as to avoid any conflict with the individual.

In other cases people who are respected by others because of different and varying reasons, the individuals might think of the respectful individual as weak.

It is very important that individuals can notice when their being respected not feared or when someone is being respectful and not weak.

Respect does not only apply to someone's behavior but on also how one's belongings are handled and treated.
