When dealing with challenges where we are required to retrieve data from a web server, 
the common question we ask ourselves is which method to use and why that method is best suited for that challenge.
As individuals we have different preference, some prefer XML over JSON and vise-versa with other individuals.
Yes both methods will carry out the purpose but do we actually know which one is best suited for the challenge and why.
This blog post gives details on the difference between the two methods.

### XML vs JSON.
XML and JSON can both be use to receive data from a web server, but the is a difference between the two even though they can be used to perform the same task.

-XML is a mark-up language and JSON is a way of representing objects.
-XML uses attributes to  structure and contain the data, while JSON uses objects and properties to do the same.
-JSON is shorter and xml contains many tags for just little data.
-JSON is easier to write and and read.
-XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.
-Syntax of JSON is lighter than XML as JSON does not contain start and end tags but XML do have start and end tags.
-JSON supports datatype and arrays while XML does not provide datatype and does not support array.
-XML support for Namespaces and Comments while JSON does not support Namespaces and comments
