### Agile manifesto.

On this day i was introduced to Agile manifesto and i found it to be very interesting as i was familiar with the methodology in theory aspects.

Agile manifesto is a software development method that consists of a formal public statement of key values, principles, practises and tools.

Through the Agile manifesto, i was given glimps of how the working environment within softwera development was, what challanges are encounterd by the team on a day-to-day babsis and what methods ar e used to come up with solutions bringing rise to progression.
