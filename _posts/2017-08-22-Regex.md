 ### Regula epressions.
Regex is one of the most useful tools a developer can have access to. Regex is used to search for pattens in a string.
The pattern can either be an alphabet, word or number.

e.g /word/gi

/ = Is the start of the regular expression.
word = Is the pattern (word) the method is said to look for.
/ = Is the end of the regular expression.
g = Means global. It informs the expression to return all matches in the string.
i = Means the exptession should ignor the case(uppercase or lowercase).

e.g var theString = "Yes, he is very good at playing soccer";
    var find = /he/gi;
    return find;
    find = 1.

The very same method can be used for numbers.
With numbers the digit selector is \d which retrieves a digit.
Appending or placing the (+) plus sign after the selector e.g  /\d+/g means the expression is matching more than one digit.
Having a uppercase version of a regular expression will invert (do the opposite) of what the smallercase does.
e.g \s = finds all the whitespaces.
    \S = finds everything that is not a whitespace.
