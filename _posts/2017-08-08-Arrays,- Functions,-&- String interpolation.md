I realized that the basics of Javascript are usually thought lightly but the basics can turn out to be the most crucial aspects of the code. 

### Arrays

These are used to store multiple values in one variable. Using square brackets [...].
Arrays can be nested within arrays. Index can be used to access array data.[[...][...]].
Multi-dimensional array is an array an array.
The .push() function can be used to append data to the end of the array.  Array.push(4).
The .Pop() function removes the last item from the array.
The .shift() function removes the last element of the array.
The .unshift function adds elements at the beginning of the array.

### Function

These are the reusable parts of the code.
Functions perform a certain action and so they are always named as verbs.
This is how a function looks at its simplest form:

Function FunctionName() {
	console.log ("Hello world");
}

The function is called by its name when it is used.
The above function will print out the words "Hello world".
Variables that are used without the "Var" keyword are global scope.

Parameters: These are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when its called.
Arguments: The actual values that are input into a function when its called.
Scope: These are variables defined outside a function.

### String interpolation
the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values
