Agile Software Development.

Reading this article widened my view towards programing and coding.
It made made realise that as much as getting the project done and having a running program is important, acknowledging change and leaving room for change is also a crusial aspect when is come to Software development.
A programmer as an idividual with much expertese and experience can create a master of a software but a team of ordenary Software developers can do much more than what that single experienced programmer can do. Through the use of self-empowerment,self-organized and cooperativeness the group can create an Agile environment also becoming an Agile team.
including the customer as part of the team makes a huge impact to the results of the program. when the customer is part of the decision making on which features to include and not, what are the priorities and what changes to be made makes a better outcome of the product in-need and to be used.
This proved to me that team work, acknowledgment of change, the use of an expertes and involving the customer in crucual decision making can the best out of nothing.
