Code review.

I and the team went through code review but i like to refire to it as peer review.
Our main objective was to find mistakes that where overlooked during the initial development stage, rectify them and increase the quality of the software.
I happen to find pair programming very usefull and advantegeous to me. As increases communication, observation, peer learning and self growth at an individual pace.
