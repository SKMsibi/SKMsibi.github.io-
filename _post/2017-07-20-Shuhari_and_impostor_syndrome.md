Shu-ha-ri.

This is a Learning concept that was extracted from the Japanese martial arts, it describes the stages of learning.
Shu-Ha-Ri;
	Shu-This is the repartion of the forms and descipline ourselves so that we can absorb the forms.
	Ha-Once disciplined to acquire the forms, we make innovations.
	Ri-	Moving away from the forms and giving rise to creativiy. Unrestrained but also not breaking the laws of the forms.

I find this concept of learning very effective as it consists of a few steps that are straight forward and simple to understand and abide by. The steps simplify learning to a point where learning seems to be a simple process yet most rewarding and advantegeous.

Impostor Syndrome
A concept decsribing high archieving individuals who are marked by  an inability to internalize their accomplishments.
these individuals concider themselves frauds. 
Knowing about this concept made me realise that some individuals can archieve great through their hardwork and still deprive themselves of the glory of their work. Due to certain inabilities or characteristics they have makes them feel as if though their archievements where givent to them on a silver platter and not fully archieved like other individuals with the same archievements.
